# GRAPE

# Introduction
GRAPE (Generator of RNA Aptamers Powered by activity-guided Evolution) is an AI-driven framework designed to accelerate RNA aptamer discovery and optimization. Aptamers are short nucleic acid sequences capable of binding specific targets with high affinity, making them valuable for applications in therapeutics, diagnostics, and synthetic biology.

Traditional aptamer selection methods, such as SELEX, often require multiple rounds of enrichment and are limited by in vitro conditions that do not fully capture intracellular interactions. GRAPE overcomes these limitations by integrating a Transformer-based conditional autoencoder with nucleic acid language models. It is uniquely guided by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) enrichment data obtained from CRISPR/Cas-based intracellular screening (CRISmers), enabling biologically relevant and highly functional aptamer generation.

GRAPE demonstrates superior performance compared to existing generative models by producing diverse, rational, and high-affinity aptamers with just a single round of intracellular screening. This has been validated across multiple targets, including human and viral proteins, highlighting its potential as a transformative tool in RNA evolution.

## Install dependencies
First, download the repository and install dependencies.

Python: 3.8.18

System: Ubuntu 22.04.4

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tansaox2008123/Grape.git
   pip install torch==2.0.1
   pip install flash-attn==2.5.6
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have any problem with install evo-model try this code 
```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

And you can get more details in these websites
RNA-FM https://github.com/ml4bio/RNA-FM.
Evo https://github.com/evo-design/evo

## Quickstart
Train your own model should follow this code
```bash
   python train.py  1 --cuda 0 --train_file datasets/RBD_dataset/RBD-train-seq.txt  --test_file datasets/RBD_dataset/RBD-test-seq.txt --model_name RBD-RNA-FM.model --batch_size 1000
```
Numbers 1, 2 represent training the model using RNA-FM, EVO respectively.
The training file format can be referenced from the dateset following file.

generation RNA aptamers should follow this code
```bash
   python generation.py 1 --cuda 0 --input_file sample_aptamers.txt --output_file output_file.txt --model_name RBD-RNA-FM.model --num 1000
```
The generation of GRAPE need sample RNA aptamers. And the format of sample_aptamers.txt should be same as training file, and the num is generating the number of aptamers seq.
Numbers 1, 2 represent training the model using RNA-FM, EVO.


The RBD and CD3e original dataset is stored on the following website.
